Here are two brief descriptions for your web app:

**Security Mode**
Design a water system you can rely on. Whether you're in a remote area without town water, preparing for uncertain times, or simply want true independence from the mains supply, this mode helps you size a tank that won't let you down. We'll calculate what you need for near-complete water security, even through extended dry periods.

**Opportunistic Mode**
Capture free water from your roof to reduce bills and environmental impact. You'll stay connected to mains water as backup, but why not use what falls on your roof? This mode helps you find the sweet spot between useful water savings and reasonable upfront cost - no need to go all-in when a modest tank will do the job.
